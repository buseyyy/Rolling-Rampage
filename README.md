# **Rolling Rampage**
Rolling Rampage is the fourth project I developed as part of the "Unity Learn Junior Programmer" program. This game was created with the aim of enhancing my skills. Several additional features have been added to the project, including the ability for the game to restart after the player falls, stronger enemies, and a powerful power-up that enables the player to shoot, which is still being worked on.

## **How To Play**
### **Basic Features**
* There is a camera system that moves with the player (camera moves with A-D, player moves with W-S).
* The game has a level system. When an enemy falls below -10 on the Y-axis, it dies, and a new enemy spawns.
* A power-up feature has been added. This feature lasts for 7 seconds and pushes the enemy a certain distance.
* Enemies try to follow the player and push them down.

### **The Project Includes the Following Additional Features:**
* If the player falls below -10 on the Y-axis, the game restarts.
* Stronger enemies have been added.

### **In progress:**
* When the player gets a powerful power-up, they will be able to shoot bullets at the enemies.

## **Unity Version**

## **Note**
This project was originally developed in 2024. It appears at the top of my GitHub profile because I have recently transferred and reorganized my older projects into my new GitHub account.
